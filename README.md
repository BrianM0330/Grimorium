# :video_game: What is Grimorium? 
Grimorium is a light-weight terminal-based application for DOTA 2 players. Picked a hero you're not familiar with? Built with Python, Grimorium quickly gets last hit numbers, and benchmarks based on data from thousands of games played on the hero that are updated every time you search. Whether you're a new player or an experienced one - the data will always be useful in helping you plan out the game. Having a rough start? Destroying the lane? You'll know exactly where you stand thanks to Grimorium. 

# :bar_chart: Why Grimorium?
Sure, you could open a browser window, go to Dotabuff.com, click the heroes tab, find your hero, click on guides, and go through 3 pages to see what the 'standard' build is. That works. Or you could open your Grimorium window, type in the hero name and have starting items in less than 2 seconds giving you more time to plan out your game or read the hero's abilities! Steam Guides are glitchy and sometimes just don't load in the picking phase leaving you at a disadvantage. This is where Grimorium can really help!

# :floppy_disk: How do I install it?
For now, to run Grimorium you'll need to clone the repo and open a terminal in the directory using ```directory.cmd```. This opens a command prompt in your directory where you can create a virtual environment and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` which will install Grimorium's required packages. After setting it all up running datacruncher.py is all you'll need to do.
